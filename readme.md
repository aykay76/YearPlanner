For some reason, back in 2001, I wanted to create my own year planner (probably just because I could). This is the MVP code for that project which demonstrates how to lay out a year planner based on the physical ones you see in most offices. The bulk of the code is in the YearPlannerView.cpp file - it's written in C++ using MFC, as was my way in 2001. Hopefully it serves as a basis for a more modern (HTML) interface. I ran the executable and amazingly it just worked without any additional runtime installations or anything.

This could easily be adapted to an HTML interface and with additional new things like SignalR could turn in an online collaborative planner quite quickly.

Please feel free to use it with the usual no cost, no warranty terms applied ðŸ˜Š

Knock Microsoft all you want but I ran my compiled version of this 20 years later and it just ran with no problems on Windows 10. That's backwards compatibility (or forward thinking) my friends!!
